                1. FEMALE FETICIDE & DECLINING SEX RATIO
            </h3>
            <div class="case-study-content">
                <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 24.195pt;">- Jhunjhunu</p>
                <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 10.602pt;">(Female Feticide & Declining Sex Ratio in Rajasthan)
                </p>
                <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
                <p>Rajasthan—a state steeped in tradition—faces a persistent crisis: the female sex ratio continues to
                    decline. After momentary improvement (from 929 in 2015–16 to 948 in 2018–19), 2023 data show a
                    reversal. The child sex ratio (0–6 years) stands at only 891 girls per 1,000 boys. Despite strict
                    laws (PCPNDT Act) banning prenatal sex determination, deep‑rooted son preference drives female
                    feticide and neglect of girl children. The theme "राजस्थान की लाडली: कोख में दम तोड़ रही उम्मीद"
                    (Rajasthan's Daughters: Hope Silenced in the Womb) captures this tragic paradox—girls denied life
                    even before birth, despite being revered in folklore and names.</p>
                <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
                <p><b>Son Preference:</b> Generations‑old belief that sons carry family lineage and provide old‑age
                    security.</p>
                <p><b> Dowry Pressure:</b> Girls seen as an economic burden due to dowry customs.</p>
                <p><b>Social Status Myth:</b> Male heirs equated with pride; daughters deemed burdensome.</p>
                <p><b>Illegal Prenatal Sex Tests:</b> Despite the PCPNDT Act, families still seek illicit ultrasounds;
                    female
                    fetuses are aborted.
                    Post‑Birth Neglect: Surviving girls face biased nutrition, school dropouts, and emotional neglect.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Even where girls are born, they confront discrimination—skipped immunizations, early marriages, and
                    emotional trauma. Some villages now resort to "bride‑buying" from other states, fueling trafficking.
                    Loneliness, depression, and low self‑esteem plague many girls who do see the light of day.
                </p>
                <h4>DATA & INSIGHTS</h4>
                <p><b>Overall Sex Ratio (2023):</b> 928 females per 1,000 males.</p>
                <p><b>Child Sex Ratio (0–6 years):</b> 891 girls per 1,000 boys (Rural: 933; Urban: 914).</p>
                <p><b>District Hotspots:</b> Shekhawati, Jhunjhunu, Churu report extreme skew—some villages haven't seen
                    a
                    single
                    girl born in years.</p>
                <p>Cultural Patterns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sons celebrated; daughters often hidden.</li>
                    <li>Rise of trafficking ("looteri brides")—in 2022, raid in Sikar district rescued 12 girls from
                        forced
                        marriages.</li>
                    <li>Psychological Toll: Girls suppressed in self‑worth, leading to depression, school dropout, and
                        sometimes suicide.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4> The Challenge Brief</h4>
                <p>Design a campaign—titled "राजस्थान की लाडली: कोख में दम तोड़ रही उम्मीद"—that:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Exposes Root Causes:</b> Dissect myths like "Beta hi vansh ko badhata hai" (only sons carry
                        lineage) and "Beti bojh hai" (daughters are burdens).</li>
                    <li><b>Educates & Empowers Families:</b> Demonstrate the economic and social value of daughters—from
                        inheritance rights to community well‑being.</li>
                    <li><b>Shifts Perception:</b> Showcase girls who excel—academics, sports, entrepreneurship—to
                        position daughters as pride rather than pity.</li>
                    <li><b>Stimulates Community Dialogue:</b> Mobilize panchayats, teachers, religious leaders to speak
                        out against sex selection.</li>
                    <li><b></b>Focus on Action:</b> Encourage reporting of illegal clinics, pledges to protect girl
                        children, and integration of girl‑child welfare into village development plans.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Key Messaging Angles</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Pride Over Pity:</b> "बेटा नहीं भगवान सहारा है, बेटी भी तो उसी की तारा है"
                        (If sons are support from God, daughters are equally divine sparks.)</li>
                    <li><b>Human Rights & Legal Duty:</b> Enforce PCPNDT Act; emphasize daughters' right to life.</li>
                    <li><b>Role Models:</b> Stories of girls excelling—e.g., Malala-style campaigns, local achievers
                        like
                        17‑year‑old archer Sandhya from Barmer.</li>
                    <li><b>Community Champions:</b> Teachers and panchayat leaders publicly vowing to protect girls.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Empowerment Over Charity:</b> Position girls as agents of change who uplift families and
                        communities.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>The Goal</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Restore Sex Ratio:</b> Achieve 950+ girls per 1,000 boys by 2028.</li>
                    <li><b>10,000 Pledges:</b> Public pledges across 100+ villages to end prenatal sex determination.
                    </li>

                        shutdowns.</li>
                    <li><b>Education Drives:</b> Integrate "Save the Girl Child" modules in 200+ rural schools by
                        end‑2025.</li>
                    <li><b>Community Dialogues:</b> Conduct 1,000 Gram Sabha/school town halls on gender justice by
                        2026.</li>
                </ul>

                    2. RIVER POLLUTION & CIVIC ACCOUNTABILITY
                </h3>
                <div class="case-study-content">
                    <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 10.602pt;">(River Clean‑Up & Civic Accountability – Jabalpur,
                        Madhya Pradesh)</p>
                    <p>Though Jabalpur lies in Madhya Pradesh, this case study can inspire river‑restoration campaigns
                        for Rajasthan's urban centers (e.g., the Chambal, the Banas).</p>
                    <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
                    <p>The Narmada (Reva) River—revered as a goddess—is central to Central India's ecology and culture.
                        Yet by 2017, even its source at Amarkantak was polluted by sewage outlets and open defecation.
                        In Jabalpur (the largest city on the Narmada), 200 MLD (million liters/day) of wastewater is
                        produced daily; only 0.55 MLD is treated. Overall, towns along Narmada generate \~200 MLD of
                        sewage, but only 87 MLD is treated—leaving 110 MLD of raw waste contaminating the river. This
                        pollution harms biodiversity (e.g., mahseer fish) and creates a mounting ecological and
                        public‑health crisis.</p>
                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Raw Urban Discharge:</b> Major drains (e.g., Gaurighat drain in Jabalpur) channel
                            untreated sewage directly into Narmada.</li>
                        <li><b>Industrial Effluents:</b> Factories (e.g., Bhedaghat gelatin plant, sugar mills) dump
                            chemical waste without treatment.</li>
                        <li><b>Non‑Functional STPs:</b> Kathaunda (50 MLD) and Lalpur (34 MLD) STPs exist but were
                            stalled for years; Omkareshwar's four STPs operate only one, due to technical failures.</li>
                        <li><b>Regulatory Failure:</b> Despite National Green Tribunal (NGT) orders (Sep 2023) and MPPCB
                            fines (₹17.22 crore on 12 towns), municipal bodies have repeatedly missed deadlines.</li>
                        <li><b></b>Multi‑District Spread:</b> Pollution is systemic—Narsinghpur's sugar factories,
                            illegal
                            sand
                            mining, and dysfunctional STPs in Mandleshwar, Badwani, etc., all contribute to river
                            contamination.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Despite recent inaugurations (e.g., Gaurighat STP in Jabalpur), thousands still see a dying
                        river, and residents continue to fall ill from contaminated water.</p>
                    <h4>DATA & INSIGHTS</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>NGT Intervention (Sep 2023):</b> Mandated MP's Environment Secretary and MPPCB to

                            centers on Narmada; found \~51 MLD untreated sewage still flows daily.</li>
                        <li><b>Pollution Load:</b> 14 cities generate \~200 MLD sewage; only \~87 MLD treated—leaving

                    <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 24.195pt;">- Raipur, Chhattisgarh</p>
                    <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 10.602pt;">(Electronic Waste Management in Raipur)</p>
                    <p>Though Raipur is in Chhattisgarh, the lessons apply to Rajasthan's growing towns (e.g., Jaipur,
                        Udaipur, Jodhpur).</p>
                    <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
                    <p>Raipur, capital of Chhattisgarh, is grappling with a surging e‑waste crisis. With ~1.6 million
                        residents generating about 2.5 kg of e‑waste per person annually, the city produces over 3,728
                        tonnes of e‑waste every year. Yet Raipur has no functional government‑authorized recycling or
                        disposal facility. Since 2018–19, discussions between the Chhattisgarh Environment Conservation
                        Board, Raipur Municipal Corporation, and Smart City authorities have stalled. A single private
                        company once collected under the Smart City initiative, but its toll‑free helpline and
                        operations have ceased. E‑waste toxins (lead, mercury, cadmium) seep into soil and groundwater,
                        threatening public health, especially for children and informal waste workers.</p>
                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>No E‑Waste Plant:</b> Planned processing facility for Mandir Hasaud has not materialized.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Defunct Collection Systems:</b> Sixteen e‑waste drop‑off centers opened under Smart City
                            have all shut down due to low usage—residents now sell old electronics to informal scrap
                            dealers.</li>
                        <li><b>Inactive Authorized Processor:</b> The sole authorized e‑waste processor under Raipur's
                            Smart City project is now defunct; no official body manages e‑waste flow.</li>
                        <li><b>Health Hazards:</b> E‑waste contains heavy metals and toxic fumes; improper dismantling
                            contaminates groundwater, soil, and air—especially harmful to children and informal
                            recyclers.</li>
                        <li><b>Public Ignorance:</b> Limited awareness of safe disposal protocols, helpline numbers, and
                            environmental consequences.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>DATA & INSIGHTS</h4>

                    <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
                    <p>Udaipur, the "City of Lakes," is also a cradle of numerous traditional art forms—Mevadi Gair
                        (tribal folk dance), Jeetmal bamboo-wooden artifacts, Pichwai textile paintings, and classic
                        miniature painting. Over generations, artisans have passed these crafts down, making them
                        integral to Udaipur's identity. Yet these art forms are vanishing due to lack of market access,
                        generational disconnect, and minimal institutional support. "Udaipur Sanskaran Abhiyan" seeks to
                        revive and sustain these indigenous traditions by connecting artisans with new‑age audiences,
                        creating livelihood opportunities, and reimagining cultural relevance.</p>
                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Disconnection from Markets:</b> Artisans lack direct access to urban buyers, e‑commerce
                            platforms, or tourism sales channels. Middlemen capture most profits.</li>
                        <li><b>Lack of Official Recognition:</b> Crafts like Mevadi Gair and Pichwai lack GI
                            (Geographical Indication) tags, undermining authenticity and pricing power.</li>
                        <li><b>Generational Gaps:</b> Younger generations abandon ancestral crafts for more lucrative
                            jobs, leaving fewer masters to train apprentices.</li>
                        <li><b>Tourism Disconnect:</b> Tourists focus on palaces, lakes, and Bollywood sets while
                            ignoring authentic craft villages.</li>
                        <li><b>Infrastructure Constraints:</b> Limited stalls, workshops, or exhibition spaces; artisans
                            must travel far to sell or demonstrate their work.</li>

                    <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 10.602pt;">(Transforming the Former Union Carbide Plant Site
                        – Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh)</p>
                    <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
                    <p>Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh, carries the deep scar of the 1984 Gas Tragedy—one of the
                        world's worst industrial disasters. The former Union Carbide pesticide plant spans approximately
                        87 acres. While toxic waste has been moved to Pithampur for treatment, the vast empty land
                        remains a painful reminder. Residents, civil society groups, and planners are debating how to
                        turn this symbol of tragedy into a site of resilience. Should it become a disaster‑memorial
                        museum, an urban forest, a research center, or a public park? Ownership disputes, legacy
                        liability, and environmental clearance issues have stalled any official master plan. Groundwater
                        contamination still affects nearby areas like JP Nagar, Atal Ayub Nagar, and Blue Moon Colony,
                        and many families continue to suffer health issues decades later.</p>
                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>

                        <li><b>Emotional Scar:</b> For thousands who lost loved ones or suffer lifelong health effects,
                            the site remains traumatic. Its desolation perpetuates collective grief.</li>
                        <li><b>Land Underutilization:</b> This 87‑acre parcel in central Bhopal lies unused under heavy
                            security. It offers no public utility or ecological function.</li>
                        <li><b>Conflicting Visions:</b> Stakeholders propose various futures—ecological forest, museum,
                            disaster memorial, public park—but no consensus or official blueprint exists.</li>
                        <li><b>Political & Legal Hurdles:</b> Ownership rights, environmental clearance, and liability
                            questions remain unresolved. Public trust is low due to decades of delayed promises.</li>
                        <li><b>Health & Safety Concerns:</b> Despite waste removal, groundwater contamination persists;
                            residents still report illnesses linked to long‑term exposure.</li>

                            converting the land into a public green space or national disaster memorial.</li>
                        <li><b>Legal/Administrative Standstill:</b> Land remains fenced with no final redevelopment

                <div class="case-study-content">
                    <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 24.195pt;">- Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh</p>
                    <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 10.602pt;">(Street Dog Attacks & Public Safety Crisis –
                        Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh)</p>
                    <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
                    <p>Gwalior has become a hotspot for a public‑health emergency: uncontrolled street dog attacks.
                        Between January and November 2024, Gwalior's government hospitals registered over 70,000 dog
                        bite cases—an average of 250 per day. The majority of victims are children (aged 6–15) and
                        elderly residents, who suffer severe injuries. Although 20,763 dogs were sterilized in the past
                        2.5 years, dog bite cases increased by 65%, signaling that current municipal actions
                        (sterilization and sporadic vaccination camps) aren't sufficing. The Birla Nagar ABC (Animal
                        Birth Control) centre can house only 8 cages (overloaded with 20–25 dogs per cage), and only 400
                        street dogs received anti‑rabies vaccines in recent camps—far too low to curb the rabies risk.
                    </p>
                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Under‑Capacity Sterilization:</b> The lone ABC centre in Birla Nagar cannot keep pace.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Inadequate Vaccination:</b> Only 400 street dogs vaccinated recently; others remain
                            unvaccinated.</li>
                        <li><b>Budget Without Strategy:</b> Over ₹42 lakhs spent on sterilizations, but no holistic
                            dog‑control plan exists.</li>
                        <li><b>Legal Apathy:</b> High Court censured Gwalior Nagar Nigam for "paperwork over action,"

                        four‑dog mauling. In February and April 2025, children aged 4–6 suffered severe facial injuries.
                        The lack of an actionable, measurable plan threatens lives daily.</p>

                    7. PREDATORY LOAN APPS & STUDENT SUICIDES
                </h3>
                <div class="case-study-content">
                    <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 24.195pt;">- Kota, Rajasthan</p>
                    <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 10.602pt;">(Predatory Loan Apps & Student Suicides – Kota,
                        Rajasthan)</p>
                    <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
                    <p>Kota, Rajasthan—India's coaching capital—draws thousands of aspirants every year. Amid intense
                        academic pressure, a new menace has emerged: illegal digital loan apps that prey on vulnerable
                        students. Promising "instant cash" with minimal checks, these apps charge exorbitant interest
                        (1,000–3,000% APR) and impose hidden fees. When borrowers default, app agents employ brutal
                        recovery tactics—harassing calls, abusive messages, threats to share morphed private
                        photos—pushing already stressed students toward despair. The Government's Ministry of Home
                        Affairs has warned that "harassment, blackmail, and harsh recovery practices" by illegal loan
                        apps are driving citizens to suicide. The Reserve Bank of India now mandates direct disbursal
                        and repayment between regulated lenders and borrowers, banning third‑party intermediaries that
                        hide behind these apps.</p>
                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Exploitative Loan Terms:</b> Apps lure students with quick loans but tack on sky‑high
                            interest and hidden fees. One student borrowed ₹46,000 and later found he owed over ₹1 lakh.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Coercive Collection Tactics:</b> Borrowers must grant app access to contacts, storage,
                            and more; agents then harass and blackmail using doctored images. A victim who borrowed
                            ₹2,000 still faced threats even after repayment.</li>
                        <li><b>Psychological Toll:</b> Constant stigma, isolation, and fear lead to depression and
                            suicide. Cases include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>A young man repaid ₹3 lakh but was still harassed; he took his life.</li>
                                <li>A Telugu student jumped into a river after app agents demanded ₹1 lakh on a ₹10,000
                                    loan.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Regulatory Gaps:</b> Most predatory apps operate outside RBI/NBFC oversight. They are
                            shell companies (many with alleged Chinese backing) that vanish when exposed. Enforcement is
                            difficult; victims struggle to report before it's too late.</li>
                        <li><b>Local Impact:</b> Kota Police report 23 student suicides in 2023 (highest toll in eight
                            years). Rajasthan recorded 22 student suicides in 2023 (highest ever). Nationally, NCRB data
                            show 13,089 student suicides in 2021, with rising share attributed to financial reasons.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Rising Student Suicides (2023):</b> 23 in Kota by August 2023—surpassing 2022's entire
                            count. Rajasthan's total student suicides in 2023: 22.</li>
                        <li><b>Financial Stress Factor:</b> NCRB attributes ~14% of suicides to "economic and financial
                            reasons." Kota's PHED Minister noted many parents borrowed heavily for coaching fees, adding
                            stress that "if they fail, what will happen to their parents?"</li>

                                <li>Andhra Pradesh: 22‑year‑old Vamshi Krishna jumped into a river after app agents
                                    demanded ₹1 lakh on a ₹10,000 loan he'd already repaid.</li>

                        </li>

                        crises.</p>
                    <h4>The Challenge Brief</h4>
                    <p>Create a social‑impact campaign that:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Educates:</b> Demystify how these apps operate—bait‑and‑switch interest rates, hidden
                            fees, data‑harvesting for blackmail. Use real cases (e.g., the student still harassed after
                            death) to expose tactics.</li>
                        <li><b>Empowers:</b> Highlight safer financial options—scholarships, regulated NBFC loans,
                            institutional counseling. Promote helplines (e.g., Bikaner's suicide prevention centre) and
                            debt‑counseling platforms.</li>
                        <li><b>Engages:</b> Rally schools, coaching centers, parents to spot warning signs (unexplained
                            stress, sudden requests for money). Push policymakers to enforce RBI guidelines, clamp down
                            on predatory apps, and fast‑track legal action.</li>
                        <li><b>Imagines the Outcome:</b> Frame the goal as saving lives: "No Kota student should lose
                            hope because of a loan app." Use striking visuals (broken chains of debt, empty study desk)
                            and peer testimonials, backed by data for credibility.</li>
                        <li><b>Maintains Urgency & Empathy:</b> Convey that these are not just numbers—they're sons and
                            daughters with potential futures cut short.</li>

                    8. CHILD BEGGING & TRAFFICKING
                </h3>
                <div class="case-study-content">
                    <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 24.195pt;">- Jaipur, Rajasthan</p>
                    <p class="font-bold" style="font-size: 10.602pt;">(Child Begging & Trafficking – Jaipur, Rajasthan)
                    </p>
                    <h4>CONTEXT</h4>
                    <p>Jaipur's streets teem with beggars—many are trafficked children forced into exploitation. Young
                        boys and girls, sometimes disfigured (hands/eyes burned to evoke pity), sit outside temples,
                        markets, and intersections pleading for alms. Child‑protection NGOs warn that most street
                        children in Jaipur are victims of organized trafficking rings. They're lured under false
                        promises of schooling or work, then confined and coerced into begging or bonded labor. Even when
                        families are not involved, recruiters exploit extreme poverty, kidnapping children from rural
                        areas. Well‑meaning citizens often give money, unaware they fuel this cycle. Jaipur authorities
                        launched a state‑wide drive in July 2021 to make the city beggar‑free and pledged to
                        rehabilitate rescued children. But despite multiple raids (e.g., a 2022 operation in a bangle
                        factory freed 14 trafficked minors), the problem persists—driven by poverty, illiteracy, and
                        weak enforcement.</p>
                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Organized Trafficking:</b> Criminal networks abduct or coerce children into begging;
                            children are drugged or intimidated (hands/eyes burned) to increase pity.</li>
                        <li><b>Poverty & Family Neglect:</b> Some families, under recruiters' influence, send children
                            to beg; others pushed into bonded labor.</li>
                        <li><b>Entrenched Demand:</b> Cultural norms treat giving alms as religious duty, normalizing
                            child begging and funding traffickers.</li>
                        <li><b>Weak Enforcement:</b> Although laws exist, convictions are rare. Example: 2022 Jaipur
                            raid freed 14 minors from forced labor in a bangle factory; traffickers charged under
                            anti‑trafficking and child‑labor laws, yet slow adjudication.</li>
                        <li><b>Reintegration Gaps:</b> Rescue efforts often focus on immediate removal; long‑term
                            rehabilitation (education, vocational training) is underfunded. Many rescued children end up
                            back on the streets.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>DATA & INSIGHTS</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>NCRB Data (2016):</b> Rajasthan recorded 1,422 human‑trafficking cases (17.5% of India's
                            total); Rajasthan police rescued 5,626 minors (5,281 boys, 345 girls)—highest rescue count
                            in India that year.</li>
                        <li><b>Childline & NGOs (2021–22):</b> Jaipur's 1098 Childline intervened ~1,800 times, rescuing
                            ~650 children from begging or exploitation.</li>
                        <li><b>Police Raids & Operations:</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Operation Muskaan (2021):</b> Government child‑rescue drive combed city
                                    intersections—rescued 200+ children nationwide, 50+ in Jaipur.</li>
                                <li><b>November 2024 TOI Report:</b> Jaipur multi‑agency teams (police + NGOs)
                                    identified 300 street children; rescued 120 in a week, with promises of
                                    rehabilitation.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>State Commission Reports (2024):</b> Rajasthan State Child Rights Commission's study
                            labeled Jaipur a "child‑labor hotspot."
                            <ul>
                                <li>Identified lack of reliable data; called for a central "beggary database."</li>
                                <li>Observed cooperation among police, Child Welfare Committees, and NGOs, but noted
                                    systemic gaps in follow‑through and funding.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Public Interventions (2021):</b> Awareness vans toured intersections, discouraging alms
                            to child beggars. Yet no unified baseline on the total number of begging children exists.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>The Challenge Brief</h4>
                    <p>Participants must create a compelling, action‑oriented campaign to end child begging and
                        trafficking in Jaipur:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Raise Awareness:</b> Educate the public that child begging is forced exploitation, not
                            harmless street poverty. Use posters or videos showing how alms fuel traffickers, or
                            social‑media explainers debunking myths (e.g., "Giving alms helps them").</li>
                        <li><b>Humanize the Issue:</b> Share stories of rescued children (fictionalized or anonymized)
                            to build empathy. For instance, showcase "child A" before (on streets) and after (in school)
                            to highlight lost potential.</li>
                        <li><b>Advocate for Action:</b> Urge citizens to report beggar rings using hotlines (e.g.,
                            1098), highlight existing shelters (Childline, state shelters), and press for transparency
                            on rehabilitation outcomes. Enlist influencers/public figures to amplify the message.</li>
                        <li><b>Promote Rehabilitation:</b> Spotlight NGOs and government programs that reintegrate
                            children—showcase success stories of vocational training and schooling ("Jaipur's children
                            in school, not on streets"). Encourage community support (donations, volunteering).</li>
                        <li><b>Engage Enforcement & Policy:</b> Demand stricter penalties for traffickers, better
                            funding for shelters, and consistent data collection. Illustrate how local police–NGO
                            collaborations have succeeded (e.g., 2022 bangle factory rescue), and push for scaling such
                            models.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h4>The Goal</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>50% Reduction in Visible Child Begging (1 Year):</b> Measured via street surveys,
                            police/NGO reports, and Childline data.</li>
                        <li><b>Increase Public Reporting by 200%:</b> Boost tips to 1098 and police about child‑begging
                            rings.</li>
                        <li><b>Expand Rehabilitation Reach:</b> Ensure every rescued child (target: 1,000 children/year)
                            enters schooling or vocational training programs.</li>
                        <li><b>Shift Public Norms:</b> Foster a citywide culture where giving money to child beggars is
                            strongly discouraged; instead, support education and welfare.</li>
                        <li><b>Policy Wins:</b> Secure municipal budget allocation for two new child‑shelter homes by
                            end‑2025; mandate data‑sharing between police, Childline, and NGOs for real‑time monitoring.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Suggested Campaign Lines</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"Child Begging Is Not Charity—It's Child Abuse."</li>
                        <li>"Alms Fuel Traffickers, Not Childhoods."</li>
                        <li>"Jaipur's Children in School, Not on Streets."</li>
                        <li>"Spot a Beggar? Dial 1098—Be the Voice They Need."</li>
                        <li>"Behind Every Beggar Is a Trafficker—Help Break the Chain."</li>
